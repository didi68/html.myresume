    <!--For my site to be properly published in my github, I had to put my other pages in a differnet folder so it can be referenced on github. Though, it can work without being in a folder, but that will be only on VS code and not in github.
    
    Also in github, there is no forward slash or full stop before the folder name. You just type the folder name and a slash and folder name, e.g "hobbies/hobbies.html" and it works. I had to do same for my images-->
